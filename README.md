# Memristor_PES
Simulating Prescribed Error Sensitivity learning using memristors.

OnlinePES is used to simulate the Prescribed Error Sensitivity learing rule.

OnlinePES-Memristor is used to simulate PES learning rules using memristor properties for the connections between neurons.

OnlinePES-Memristor-rand is used to simulate PES learning rules using memristor properties for the connections between neurons with random initialization of memristors.
